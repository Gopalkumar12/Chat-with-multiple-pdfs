Key features include:

Multiple PDF Upload: Users can securely upload multiple PDF files in a single session.
Content Extraction: The system extracts text from the PDFs, including handling scanned documents using OCR if necessary.
Query Processing: Users can submit questions based on the content of the uploaded PDFs, with the system analyzing the extracted data to provide relevant responses.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface allows easy navigation between uploaded files and question submission, ensuring a seamless user experience.
